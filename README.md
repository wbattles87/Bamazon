# Bamazon
Creating an amazon like database using nodejs and mySQL

Steps and Walk through:

1) First create a database called bamazon with a table inside called products




2)  Create the JS file bamazoncustomer.js.   Link this to the MySQL server and contain all the necessary code for the project.




3)  The goal of the project is to connect from VS Code (using node js) to MySQL on our created server.  We then in the terminal first display the items in our inventory with their unique id, name, department price and how many in stock.  We then ask the user which item they would like to purchase and then how many.  The final step is to confirm we have this all in stock and give the customer their total.  This code can all be found in the bamazoncustomer.js file.


4) The final output in the terminal of our project should look like below.
